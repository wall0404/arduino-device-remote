# arduino-device-remote
 Arduino library to control devices via network,rs232 or ir interface by led buttons


# Work in progress

## TODO: 
- the interface for the different device types are not implemented yet
  - ~~network devices~~
  - ~~rs232~~
  - ir
- master/slave modus, so that all buttons from a slave device turn off when master devices is turned off 
- callback to register a device change from outside (e.g. to toggle the led on the button when the device was turned on by another remote)
